# Leip Logeerpartijtje - Pocket Edition

I started this project for the semester 3 passion project. Here I want to make a portable version for Leip Logeerpartijtje.

## Installation

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) if you don't have them yet.
2. Press 'Code' on the GitLab page.
3. You now see 'Clone with HTTPS', copy the link.
4. Open 'cmd' and type `cd [the path you want this project to be in]` and press enter
5. Now type `git clone [the link you copied]`
6. You have now successfully installed the project.

## Opening the project

1. Open Unreal Engine
2. On the bottom right, you see 'browse' press that
3. Open the 'llpe.uproject' file
4. You have now opened the project

## Running the game

Since I don't made a build of the game and it isn't a full version you need to do the following to run the game:
1. Press the 'Content Drawer' button bottom left
2. Open 'Bordspel.umap'
3. Now press ALT+P to play the level. You can also press the play button at the top.
